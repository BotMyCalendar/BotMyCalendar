This project comes from four students who realize the optimization of time that could mean being able to make a bot to send messages without being a company and  without having programming knowledge; using Google Calendar only, the simplest way. Forget to set alarms to send messages and forget event reminders.</p>

We took the google calendar API to complement our app and we want expand it to more fields such as discord, telegram and also whatsapp!

## Inspiration
Today people are more connected than ever so there are no excuses for not to congratulate someone or for remember an special date to someone sending a message. So what's wrong? Why we need this bot? What it does?

The answer is simple: how many times have you thought about texting someone to either congratulate them on their birthday, send them a hug, and say hello at Christmas parties... and finally forgot?
If you are human, the answer should be "ever". So let's talk about what it does.

## What it does
Bot My Calendar is a "simple" bot that allows you not to forget to send any message to your loved ones. In essence, Bot My Calendar sends the message you want through the social network you decide (from among those supported in the current version) *. 
You just have to specify the message, to whom and when you want it to be sent: which would be simply adding a calendar event.

_Supported social network messages: Discord_

## How we built it
We built the bot using pyhton and some APIs as GoogleCalendarAPI...

## Challenges we ran into
- _IThinkUPC Challenge_
- _UPC Challenge_

## What we learned
We have learned a **LOT**!!! This inmersive project has been a change in our way of thinking and facing challenges. We made team and we worked to a common goal. It has been awesome.

## What's next for Bot My Calendar
Soon Bot My Calendar will additionally support Discord: WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.
We are working on communication with companies so that they enable us APIs. With that, we would like to expand our services adding new messaging platforms.
