<h1 align="center"> BotMyCalendar.github.io</h1>
Bot Calendar is a simple way to automate messages using google calendar events. This project comes from four students who realize the optimization of time that could
mean being able to make a bot to send messages without being a company and without having programming knowledge; using Google Calendar only, the simplest way.
Forget to set alarms to send messages and forget event reminders.

We took the google calendar API to complement our app and we want expand it to more fields such as discord, telegram and also whatsapp
