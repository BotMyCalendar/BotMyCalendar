This project comes from four students who realize the optimization of time that could mean being able to make a bot to send messages without being a company and  without having programming knowledge; using Google Calendar only, the simplest way. Forget to set alarms to send messages and forget event reminders.</p>

We took the google calendar API to complement our app and we want expand it to more fields such as discord, telegram and also whatsapp!
